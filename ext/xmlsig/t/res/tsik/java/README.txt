Makefile has the following targets:

sign:
	Generate the files in ../in for the language binding tests

verify-self:
	Verifies Java output

verify:
	Verifies the output generated by the language binding lib
	(expects files to be in ../../../out*.xml)

clean:
	Remove class files

To run these tests on a specific language binding library, navigate
to the t/tsik_interop directory and run make there.
