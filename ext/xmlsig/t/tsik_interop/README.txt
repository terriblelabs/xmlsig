Makefile has the following targets:

sign:
	Generate the files in .. for the Java verification tests

java-verify:
	Runs the Java code to verify our output

verify:
	Verifies the output generated by the Java library

verify-self:
	Verifies the output generated by the language binding lib
	(expects files to be in ../../../out*.xml)

clean:
	Remove generated files

To run these tests, run "make"; the default target will run sign,
verify, verify-self and java-verify.

If no errors occur, the test code executes silently.
