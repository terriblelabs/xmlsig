This is the C++ source for the xmlsig library.  It is intended to be
wrapped using the swig interface file in swig/xmlsig.i.

Note that each language specific module builds this source with their
own build scripts.  The local Makefile is provided for debugging
purposes, and is not intended to be used for building the wrapper
libraries.
